Sass Smart Grid Framework
=================
Very Simple to use framework.  Just the bare bones now; but very powerful in it application.  You can use this to create fluid layouts that change at the turn of a dime, and along with that you can specify a set of columns to assure that your nested layouts. Layouts with differing columns in different rows will all align.  

The magic is under the hood fork and test it out if you would like I will try to update when I get more on the todos or any suggestions on the todos.

##Requirements

Sass >= 3.2.5

##TODO:
*  mostly meant for fluid layouts hoping to make it flexible enough for static layout as well
*  ways to degrade experience no legacy support for non nth as of yet if you don't choose semantic markup.
